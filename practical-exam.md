# Final Practical Exam

For the Final Practical exam you will be converting your SPENDR wireframes to hi-fidelity mockups. Your goals should be:

- Strong UI - can users quickly find what they need and make changes with a minimal amount of friction?
- Strong focus on [the 5 principles of visual design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/principles-visual-design/)
- Clear association between your wireframe and hi-fidelity mockup
- Aesthetically pleasing - is your app pleasant to look at and navigate around?
- Good use of Figma - think of your audience (potentially your boss or client), does the mockup do a good job of demonstrating how the app will work?

**IMPORTANT:** Do **NOT** use the same working file. You should create a duplicate of your wireframes, or simply start a new file and copy/paste elements into it.

When complete, do **NOT** submit your Figma file - instead, drag the file into the shared Figma folder called "Final Practical Exam".

### Your hi-fidelity mockups should now include:

- A colour scheme
- Imagery (photographs or illustrations)
- Icons (found online or custom)
- More intentional design
- More accurate copy (text)

### Your mockup should allow at least basic functionality, including:

- Navigation
- Menus (if applicable)
- Favouriting (if applicable)
- Interactions for links, buttons and any other interactive elements

### You should be considering "user flow" through the app:

- What are the paths users will follow?
- Are they able to navigate around the app without getting "trapped"?
- Can they complete the various goals with a minimal amount of friction?

### How to get a good grade:

- I recommend starting with a colour scheme, and decisions about how and where your colour(s) will be applied.
- Consider your colour scheme carefully. Consider what colour your "action" buttons and other interactive elements will be. Consider how you will highlight important areas, warnings or errors to users.
- You can use the default Figma font (Inter) or you can choose a custom font - take care with this, it can be easy to get carried away with fonts!
- You should use interactions and even animations, but try to keep the focus on what will make the mockup most useful to it's target audience (your boss or client).
- Always bear in mind the five principles of visual design:
  - Scale (size signals the importance of elements in your design)
  - Visual hierarchy (guiding the eye by using a hierarchy in your layouts)
  - Balance (even distribution of your elements across the layout)
  - Contrast (strong use of colour balance to highlight important areas)
  - Gestalt (looking at your design as the sum of it's parts as well as the individual elements)
