## Design project #2

The goal of the Design Project is to create visual wireframes for the SPENDR app based upon your research in the case study.

**REMEMBER!** There should be clear, traceable connections from your case study to your wireframes. 

**IMPORTANT:** Do not submit via Blackboard! Drag your wireframe into the shared team folder called "Design Project #2".

**IMPORTANT:** This will be a mobile web app, so you can use one of the mobile sized frames in Figma, no need for a desktop or tablet mockup.  

## About the project

The subject matter for the final evaluations was chosen for a reason - to encourage students to think about data and to think about the UI decisions that might make displaying and interacting with this data as simple as possible for users.

You may not have a mortgage, a TFSA or RRSP or a credit card, and the goal of the project is not to turn you into financial experts. However, much like the real world, in the research phase you are expected to develop at least a rudimentary understanding of these topics in order to build accurate and appropriate layouts.

Another aspect of this project is the breadth of the topic - a personal finance management app is a massively complex undertaking. In reality this may be an impossible undertaking, either because the APIs required to build it do not exist or because the size and complexity of the app would make it unviable.

However, this process also mirrors the real world - research, wireframes and mockups are the tools used to determine the viability of a project, **NOT** code.

## What to include

The breadth of the topic means that students will need to make some decisions when building their wireframes. For example, the views and functionality required to allow users to transfer money are relatively simple, whereas the views required to add a mortgage might be massively complex and require a great deal of research and understanding of the topic. How can you determine what you should include in your wireframes?

To answer this question, always consider the two following points:

- What views/layouts will give your boss or client the best possible overview of how users will interact with the app
- What level of detail conveys the greatest level of meaning

In short, I would not expect to see views that represent the entire process of adding a mortgage to the app, but I would expect to see all relevant views for a money transfer including contact management, transfer history and the transfer process.

The wireframe should be:

- Low fidelity - focus on layout and perceived functionality
- Default font only
- Black and white (greyscale) only
- No images or icons
- No interactivity (no links, hover effects, etc.)

## What to include

To understand what should be included, you should consider the real-world use case. Your boss or client needs to understand the general flow of the app, how users will navigate around the app and how the various features of the app will be represented.

The goal of the wireframe is **NOT** to document every possible view or to highlight every possible piece of functionality.



## Rubric

- Understanding of the subject

- Case study informs the wireframes
  - Research and consideration from the case study is represented in the wireframes.
- Critical analysis
  - Student evaluates the design, UI and UX with clear goals in mind.
- Presentation
  - The case study is well written and well presented.
