# Case study - UI and UX in finance apps

Your goal for the case study will be to research existing apps and prior art for the fictional app we will be building called SPENDR.

## Deliverables

- Screenshots from around 2 or 3 existing finance apps that will serve as the design inspiration for what you eventually build.
- Some notes on features or UI/UX conventions you like and plan to use.
- Some thoughts on existing conventions. Is there a pattern all apps seem to follow? Is there a design or UI that you think will work that you don't see in existing apps? Why do you think that is?

## Some things to bear in mind

- Make sure you are always focused on the user! How easily can the user accomplish the various tasks and objectives? What might users not understand, and how can you help them?
