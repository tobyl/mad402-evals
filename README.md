# MAD402 remaining evaluations

There are three remaining evaluations left in the semester (case study, design project, practical exam), and they will all focus on the same subject matter.

We will be moving through the various stages, with the evaluations as the final step in each stage.

For the case study, we will conduct research, collect data and develop a plan for our wireframes. In the design project, we'll wireframe the app based upon our findings from the case study. Finally, in the practical exam we'll build hi-fidelity mockups for our app with the wireframe as the template. 

## The three stages

### Case study

- topic research (make sure you understand the topic!)
- prior art (what apps out there are similar, how do they work, what is the value proposition, how do they make money?)
- design/ui/ux research (choose 2 - 3 mockups on dribbble to use as design inspiration)
- user personas (who is the target audience? who is the ideal user for this app?)

### Design project #2

- initial sketches
- full wireframe

### Practical exam #2

- high fidelity mockup
- interactions
- variables

## Evaluation metrics

In addition to the rubric for each evaluation, I will also be looking for evidence that you are utilizing the skills learned in the semester as you move throughout the various stages. I expect to see clear, tangible connections between each of the three evaluations. Your wireframe in the design project should contain clear references to your findings from the case study. Your hi-fidelity mockups in the final practical exam should be a clear evolution of the wireframe created in the design project.

## Project brief

The project brief is designed to mirror the real world for what you might receive before the planning phase of a project.
