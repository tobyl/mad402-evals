# Case study - UI and UX in finance apps

Your goal for the case study will be to research existing apps and prior art for the fictional app we will be building called SPENDR.

I recommend thinking about the case study in terms of "what research, thinking or evaluation would help me best in the wireframe phase". For example, you might consider:

- Data (what data might be displayed in various areas of the app and how)
- Actions (what can a user actually "do" in the app? what actions might we allow them to take, what actions shouldn't they be able to take? Why?)
- Transaction types (what financial transactions require which types of data and interactions? For example, to send money to someone, we need at least their name and contact information, the amount to send and the source to send from)
- Specific UI paradigms (which UI paradigms work well for finance apps? or for specific transactions, such as sending or receiving money?)
- Hierarchy/structure (what is most important to the user? what will they interact with most frequently?)

## Deliverables

- Screenshots from around 2 or 3 existing finance apps (from Dribbble, real-world apps or around the web) that will serve as the design inspiration for what you eventually build.
- Some notes on features or UI/UX conventions you like and plan to use.
- Some thoughts on existing conventions. Are there common patterns among finance apps? Is there a design or UI that you think will work that you don't see in existing apps? Why do you think that is?
- You don't need to build out full [user personas](https://next-edu-tobyl.vercel.app/weeks/08), but you should provide some information on potential users. What is the target audience for the app? Who is the ideal user for this app? What features might be appealing to which users?
- Think about ways to display financial data. How can we most clearly and succinctly display different types of financial data? How can we collect data from users when we need it (transfers, deposits, etc.)?
- A conclusion, summarising what you think will make the app successful, some detail on obstacles and opportunities and any areas you plan to focus on when building the wireframes.

I won't be counting words, but your written piece should be around 2 - 3 pages.

## Some things to bear in mind

- Prefer objective fact over opinion.
- Make sure you are always focused on the user! How easily can the user accomplish the various tasks and objectives? What might users not understand, and how can you help them?
- Avoid overly general or subjective statements. Don't write that "the app is minimal", explain how "there is a clear focus on each page guiding the user". Don't write that "I like the investments page", write that "the investments page is clearly laid out, with only relevant data presented to the user".
- Use bullet points in addition to written paragraphs where appropriate.
- Consider the types of data the app will display - Do you know enough about them to build your wireframes? 
- Remember - the case study sets you up for success when you build out the wireframes. Think about the notes, data and ideas that will help you in the following phases!

## Evaluation

The rubric for the case study is as follows:

- **Depth/quality of research**
  - Student has collected valuable data that will help them as they build out the wireframes.
    
- **Understanding of the topic**
  - Student understands the UI/UX subject matter, and has applied knowledge learned in class.
    
- **Critical analysis**
  - Student evaluates the design, UI and UX with clear goals in mind.
    
- **Presentation**
  - The case study is well written and well presented.

## Submission

You should save your case study on a public GitHub repo and add the link to your Blackboard submission.
