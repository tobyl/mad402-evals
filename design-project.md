## Design project #2

The goal of the Design Project is to create visual wireframes for the SPENDR app based upon your research in the case study.

## IMPORTANT

- There should be clear, traceable connections from your case study to your wireframes. 
- Do not submit via Blackboard! Drag your wireframe into the shared team folder called "Design Project #2".
- This will be a mobile web app, so you can use one of the mobile sized frames in Figma, no need for a desktop or tablet mockup.  

## About the project

The subject matter for the final evaluations was chosen for a reason - to encourage students to think about data and to think about the UI decisions that might make displaying and interacting with this data as simple as possible for users.

You may not have a mortgage, a TFSA or RRSP or a credit card, and the goal of the project is not to turn you into financial experts. However, much like the real world, in the research phase you are expected to develop at least a rudimentary understanding of these topics in order to build accurate and appropriate layouts.

Another aspect of this project is the breadth of the topic - a personal finance management app is a massively complex undertaking. In reality this may be an impossible undertaking, either because the APIs required to build it do not exist or because the size and complexity of the app would make it unviable.

However, this process also mirrors the real world - research, wireframes and mockups are the tools used to determine the viability of a project, **NOT** code.

## What to include

The breadth of the topic means that students will need to make some decisions when building their wireframes. For example, the views and functionality required to allow users to transfer money are relatively simple, whereas the views required to add a mortgage might be massively complex and require a great deal of research and understanding of the topic. How can you determine what you should include in your wireframes?

To answer this question, always consider the two following points:

- What views/layouts will give your boss or client the best possible overview of how users will interact with the app
- What level of detail conveys the greatest level of meaning

In short, I would not expect to see views that represent the entire process of adding a mortgage to the app, but I would expect to see all relevant views for a money transfer including contact management, transfer history and the transfer process.

## Common pages

Your app should include a home page (a dashboard page, not the app splash screen) and some other common pages, such as profile and settings. However, these can be brief - no need for pages showing every aspect of user management or settings. Consider the primary goal of the wireframe - your boss is probably already familiar with the process users will follow to reset their password. 

The wireframe should be:

- Low fidelity - focus on layout and perceived functionality
- Default font only
- Black and white (greyscale) only
- No images or icons
- No interactivity (no links, hover effects, etc.)

## To get the best possible grade

- Focus on the user - what design/UI makes the data the most accessible for the user?
- Consider the data - what is the optimal way to display data? How can data be aggregated for the benefit of the user?
- Look for opportunities - financial data can be boring lists, charts or graphs - is there a better way?
- Consider the potential obstacles - large amounts of data can be overwhelming. Financial transactions can be complex. How can we solve or minimize these and other obstacles?
- Use real data! You don't need to go as far as calculating interest to display correct amounts, but you should be using real numbers and real copy as much as possible.
- **COME TO CLASS**! If you're stuck on something, I can provide feedback and make suggestions. If you're not sure you're focusing on the right areas, I can clarify. If your wireframe is missing something important, I will let you know.

## Rubric

- Understanding of the subject/problem solving
  - Student has made a genuine effort to understand the subject matter and create wireframes that attempt to solve some of the problems presented by the complexity and the breadth of the topic.
- Takes into account the princles of visual design and the ten usability heuristics.
  - Student pays attention to concepts such as scale and hierarchy in their layouts, and considers aspects such as minimalism and consistency.
- Case study/research informs the wireframes
  - Discoveries and decisions from the case study are evident in the wireframes.
- Understanding of the tools
  - Student is comfortable working in Figma and uses the app functionality to create a strong, consistent wireframe.
- Attention to detail
 
## Submission

There is a shared folder in Figam called "design Project #2". Upon completion, drag your wireframe to this shared folder. If you do not have access or Figma does not allow you to drag your mockup to this folder, please contact me via email **BEFORE** the deadline.
